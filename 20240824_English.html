Sneak up.
The phrase "sneak up" means to approach someone or something quietly and stealthily, often without being noticed. It can be used both literally and figuratively: Literal: Physically moving closer to someone or something without drawing attention. Example: "He tried to sneak up on his friend to scare him." Figurative: Referring to something unexpected happening or catching someone off guard. Example: "The deadline really snuck up on me this time." The phrase usually carries a sense of .

Take potshots.
The phrase "take potshots" generally refers to: Criticism: Making casual, unfair, or critical remarks, often in a way that seems petty or unconstructive. Example: "The audience kept taking potshots at the speaker during the Q&A." Shooting: Firing shots without careful aim, typically at random or opportunistic targets. This is often used in a literal sense but can also be metaphorical. Example: "The soldiers took potshots at the enemy from behind cover." The meaning depends on whether it's being used metaphorically (criticism) or literally (aimless or opportunistic shooting).

sought out.
The phrase "sought out" means to actively look for or search for something or someone with effort and intention. It's often used to describe pursuing something specific, like information, opportunities, or a person, rather than coming across it by chance.

butting in.
"To butt in" means to interrupt or join a conversation or situation uninvited, often in a way that is considered rude or intrusive. It implies entering someone else’s discussion or affairs without permission, usually offering opinions or advice that were not asked for. For example: "I was talking to Jane about my weekend plans, and Tom just butted in with his own story." "She tends to butt in when people are having private conversations." "Butting in" is generally seen as impolite because it disregards the boundaries of others' interactions.

had it out.
To "have it out with someone" means to confront someone directly about an issue, often to resolve a conflict or misunderstanding. This expression implies a frank, open conversation, where both parties may air grievances or frustrations in order to reach a resolution. For example: "After days of tension, she decided to have it out with her coworker to clear the air." It often involves a serious discussion and sometimes intense emotions, but the goal is usually to resolve the problem.

we tight.
The phrase "we tight" is a casual, slang expression that typically means: Close Relationship: It indicates a strong, close, or trusting bond between two people. Example: "Don’t worry, we tight—I’ve got your back." Good Terms: It can also mean that everything is good or there are no issues between the people involved. Example: "Yeah, we had a fight last week, but now we tight again." It’s commonly used in informal conversations and suggests a sense of camaraderie or loyalt.

LEO.
In the context of criminal activity, "LEO" is an acronym for Law Enforcement Officer.

Okey-doke.

K turn.
A "K-turn" (also known as a three-point turn) is a driving maneuver used to turn the vehicle around in a limited space, such as a narrow road. It's called a "K-turn" because the vehicle's movement often resembles the shape of the letter "K" when viewed from above.

pull over.
In driving, "pull over" means to move a vehicle to the side of the road and come to a stop. This is often done in response to a situation that requires the driver to stop temporarily, such as obeying a police officer's request, addressing an emergency, checking directions, or allowing faster traffic to pass.

mug.
The word "mug" has two distinct meanings, each with different origins: Mug as a Cup: This usage comes from the Scandinavian word mugg, which referred to a drinking vessel. Over time, it became associated with large cups, often with handles, used for drinking hot beverages like coffee or tea. Mug as Robbery: The verb "to mug" meaning to rob someone by attacking them (usually on the street) originates from British slang in the 19th century. It’s thought to be linked to the slang term "mug" for a face (as in "mugshot" for a police photo). Criminals would confront victims face-to-face, which may have led to this association. So, while "mug" as a cup and "mug" as robbery share the same word, they have separate linguistic roots and evolved independently over time..

pull out.
In driving, "pull out" means to move a vehicle from a stationary position into active traffic. This typically involves entering the flow of cars from a parking spot, driveway, or side street, and it requires caution to ensure that it’s safe to join or cross traffic without causing disruption or accidents.

in the thick of.
"In the thick of something" means being deeply involved or fully engaged in a challenging, intense, or busy situation. When someone is "in the thick of it," they're often surrounded by action, difficulties, or activity, usually in a way that requires their full attention and effort. For example: "During the project deadline, she was in the thick of it, working late every night." "He found himself in the thick of the debate, defending his viewpoint against many others." The phrase conveys being at the center of the action.

drive-in.
"To the drive-in": Refers to going to a drive-in movie theater, a popular dating venue in the mid-1900s, where couples would watch movies from the comfort of their cars.

Peggy Sue.
"Peggy Sue" is best known as the title of a famous song by Buddy Holly, released in 1957. The song, "Peggy Sue," became a rock and roll classic and was one of Holly's biggest hits. The song was reportedly named after Peggy Sue Gerron, the girlfriend (and later wife) of Holly's bandmate, Jerry Allison, from The Crickets.

Come to think of it.
"Come to think of it" is an expression used when someone suddenly remembers or realizes something upon reflection. It's often said when reconsidering a previous thought or recalling a detail that was overlooked initially. For example: "Come to think of it, I did see her at the store yesterday." This phrase helps introduce a new thought or realization that adds to the conversation.

Word!.
When someone responds with "Word!" after another person says something, it's a slang term that conveys agreement, affirmation, or validation. It's like saying "I agree," "That's true," or "Exactly!" It's often used in casual or informal conversations and has roots in hip-hop culture, where it became a way to emphasize agreement or approval. For example: Person 1: "That movie was amazing!" Person 2: "Word!" (meaning "I totally agree!").

baloney.
"Baloney" is a slang term used to describe nonsense, foolishness, or something that's untrue or exaggerated. When someone says, "That's baloney!" they mean that what’s being said is ridiculous or not believable. The term can also refer to bologna, a type of inexpensive, processed sausage or deli meat, which may have contributed to the slang meaning of "baloney" as something insubstantial or not taken seriously.

Woodstock.
Woodstock was originally a famous music festival, not a show in the traditional sense. The first Woodstock took place in August 1969 in Bethel, New York, and became iconic for its lineup of rock and folk music, countercultural spirit, and massive crowds.

cut-rate.
"Cut rate" refers to a reduced price or discount on goods or services. It implies a price lower than the standard or usual rate, often offered to attract customers or clear inventory. The term can also describe something provided at a lower quality due to the cost reduction. For example, a "cut-rate airline" might offer cheaper fares but fewer amenities.

hand signal.
Hand signals are used by drivers to communicate their intentions to other road users when their vehicle’s signal lights are malfunctioning or in certain driving situations (e.g., cyclists).
Cue the cavalry.

The phrase "cue the cavalry" is an idiomatic expression used to signal the need for immediate assistance or intervention, often in a challenging situation. Historically, the cavalry referred to a military unit of soldiers on horseback, known for their speed and ability to provide rapid support during battles. In modern usage, "cue the cavalry" metaphorically suggests calling in reinforcements or help when facing difficulties. It's important to distinguish between "cavalry" and "Calvary," as they are often confused. "Cavalry" refers to the military unit, while "Calvary" denotes the hill outside Jerusalem where Jesus was crucified. Misusing these terms can lead to misunderstandings.
